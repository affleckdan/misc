                    <h3>What is Alpha-Phonics?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Alpha-Phonics</strong> is a complete phonics reading instruction designed by Samuel L. Blumenfeld for little beginners but is regularly used by all ages to learn improve reading. It is complete; nothing else is needed. Anyone who can read can teach anyone to read with it.</p><br>
                    <h3>Samuel L. Blumenfeld</h3>
                    <p>Sam Blumenfeld published ten books on education in America. He spent much of his career investigating the declne in American literacy and the reason for the high rate of learning disabilities in American childern. Blumenfeld became aware of the reading problem in 1961. He was asked to join the Advisory Council of the Reading Reform Foundation. In 1972 he wrote The New Illiterates in which he traced the history of reading instruction in America and diagnosed the causes of reading disability. Mr. Blumenfeld has taught in schools and tutored privately, developing his own system of intensive phonics. Alpha-Phonics is the result of his research. "I wanted to create an effective, inexpensive and uncomplicated reading instruction program that could be used as widely as possible to help solve America's reading problem."</p><br>

                    <h1>Alphabet</h1><br>
                    <h3>Teaching the Alphabet</h3>
                    <p>The alphabet is a tremndously exciting invention based on a great discovery: that all of human language is composed of a small number of irreducible speech sounds. In teaching the alphabet, you can convey to your student the excitement of this great discovery and the marvelous invention based on it. "Did you know that every word you speak can be put down on paper?" you tell the student. That's exciting. "And that's what you are going to learn to do -- to put down on paper every sound of speech you make."</p>
                    
                    <p>Thus, you've established the concept of a set of written symbols representing speech sounds. This is the association you want to establish in the student's mind: that letters on paper stand for sounds he can make with his voice, and that the sounds he makes can be put down on paper by way of letters representing them.</p>
                    
                    <p>For a younger child who has not yet learned the alphabet, the fastest and most efficent way to teach it is to have the child repeat it after you in alphabetical order while you point to the letters. Thus, the child learns the alphabet both orally and visually. Usually the oral learning will be faster than the visual; since the oral alphabet, when repeated often enough, is learned almost like a melody or a poem. The alphabet lends itself easily to this kind of learning since it can be broken up into rythmical and rhyming lines as follows:</p><br>
                    
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="img/alphabet.jpg"><br>
                    
                    <p>It will take some time before the child's visual learning catches up with his oral knowledge. Indeed, some children learn to recite the alphabet perfectly long before they are able to identify all of the letters at random. This is perfectly normal since the child has had much oral practice learning to speak the language. However, now he is required to do highly precise visual learning, which may take some getting used to, especially if the child has had little exposure to print.</p>
                    
                    <p>Children with photographic memories will learn visually much faster than those not so favorably endowed. The slowest learners will be those with weak visual memories. These children will benefit most from simple alphabetic exercises, such as repeating the letters at random, several at a time, as in the Prereading Alphabet Exercises in the Workbook, and by reviewing the alphabet flash cards that are included with this program.</p><br>
                    
                    <h3>Some Practical Suggestions</h3>
                    
                    <p><strong>Please note that this manual is written as if addressed to an instructor who has one student. However, the information in this manual applies equally to a teacher who has a classroom of students.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Ideally, each student should have his or her own copy of <em>Blumenfeld's Alpha-Phonics</em>, plus a lined notebook in which to write the words being learned. This will reduce the need for time-consuming board work by the teacher.</p>
                    
                    <p>Writing the words helps in learning to spell them correctly. Also, it is advisable to assign some written homework after each learning session. The purpose of homework is to speed up the acquisition, retention, and improvement of skills.</p>

                    <h1>Writing</h1><br>
                    <h3>Suggestions on Writing Instruction</h3>
                    <p>Writing is an important part of learning to read. But how should you teach the learner to write? The learner should draw the letters of the alphabet when learning the letters in isolation. Once words are being read, the learner should be taught to write them in cursive script.</p>
                    
                    <p>Cursive helps a child learn to read. With the prevalent ball-and-stick method, it is very easy for the learner to confuse <em>b's</em> and <em>d's</em>. But with cursive, a <em>b</em> starts like an <em>l</em> as in <em>lead</em>, and a <em>d</em> starts like an <em>a</em>. The distinction that is made in writing the letters in cursive carries over to the reading process.</p>
                    
                    <p>In addition, in writing print script, the letters will be all over the page, sometimes written from left to right and sometimes from right to left. In cursive, where all the letters are joined, the student learns directional discipline because the letters must be joined from left to right. This helps in learning to spell, for how the letters join with one another creates habits of hand movement that automatically aid the spelling process.</p>
                    
                    <p>Of course, the learner should also be taught to print. This can easily be done after the learner has developed a good cursive handwriting.</p><br>
                    
                    <h3>Cursive First</h3>
                    
                    <p>The reason a child should be taught cursive first is that learning to print first may prevent a learner from developing a good cursive handwriting. However, if you learn to write cursive first, you can always learn to print later very nicely. In other words, learning cursive first does not prevent the development of a good printing style, while print first will create fixed writing habits that will prevent the development of a good cursive script.</p><br>
                    
                    <h3>The Benefits of Cursive for the Left-Handed Learner</h3>
                    
                    <p>Another important benefit of learning cursive first is if the learner is left-handed. A right-handed writer tilts the paper counter-clockwise in order to give one's handwriting the proper slant. With the left-handed learner, the paper must be tilted in an extreme clockwise position so that the student can write from bottom up. If the paper is not tilted to the right, the left-handed student may want to use the hook form of writing. This usually happens when the learner is taught ball-and-stick method first with the paper in a straight up position.</p>
