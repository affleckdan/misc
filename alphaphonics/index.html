   <div class="fluid lesson_text"><h2>What is Alpha-Phonics?</h2>
   	<p> Alpha-Phonics is a complete phonics reading instruction designed by Samuel L. Blumenfeld for little beginners but is regularly used by all ages to learn improve reading. It is complete; nothing else is needed. Anyone who can read can teach anyone to read with it.</p>
    <h2>Samuel L. Blumenfeld</h2>
    <p><div class="float_right"><img src="assets/sam-blumenfeld.jpg" alt="" width="" height="250"/></div>Samuel L. Blumenfeld published ten books on education in America, and spent much of his career investigating the following problems: the decline in American literacy, the reasons for the high rate of learning disabilities in American children, the reasons behind the educational establishment in America's support for sex and drug education, the reasons why so many children are labeled ADD, and why the school system refuses to use intensive phonics in reading instruction and memorization in mathematics instruction. His commentary on education issues and his following as a speaker brought him to lecture in every state in the United States as well as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and England. He is internationally recognized as a leader in the intensive, systematic phonics movement.</p>
    <p>Blumenfeld became aware of the reading problem in 1961. He was asked to join the Advisory Council of the Reading Reform Foundation. In 1972 he wrote <b>The New Illiterates</b> in which he traced the history of reading instruction in America and diagnosed the causes of reading disability. Mr. Blumenfeld has taught in schools and tutored privately, developing his own system of intensive phonics. <b>Alpha-Phonics</b> is the result of his research. <i>"I wanted to create an effective, inexpensive and uncomplicated reading instruction program that could be used as widely as possible to help solve America's reading problem."</i></p>
