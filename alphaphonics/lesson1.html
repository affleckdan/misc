  	<p>Part 1 teaches all of the consonants with just one vowel - <b>short a</b>.</p>
    <p>After completion of the 14 lessons, the learner will be ready to read the <b>First Alpha-Phonics Reader</b>, which consists of only short <b>a</b> words.</p>
    <p>After successfully reading the first book, the learner will have great incentive to keep learning so that he or she can read <b>Book Two</b>.</p>
    <p>There are eleven little readers in all, to be used throughout the <b>Alpha-Phonics</b> instruction program. They were created to give the learner a sense of increased mastery as he or she learns to read.</p>

  	<h2><b>Short a</b>; consonants <b>m, n, s, t, x</b></h2>
    <p>Have the learner turn to <b>Lesson 1 in the <a target="_blank" href="http://blumenfeld.campconstitution.net/Books/Alpha-Phonics%20Workbook.pdf">Workbook</a></b>. Start by telling the learner that you are now going to teach the sounds the letters stand for. Say:</p>
    <div class="quote_text">
    	"When you learned the alphabet, you learned the names of the letters. Now you're going to learn the sounds the letters stand for. Let's start with the first sound. Now listen to the sound I make."
      </div>
    <p>Make a <b>short a</b> sound. (The <b>short a</b> is the <b>a</b> in <b>at</b>.)</p>
    <nav class="quote_text">
    	"Did you hear that sound?"
      </nav>
   <p>Make it again and ask the learner to repeat it after you.</p>
   	<nav class="quote_text">
    	"That sound is not a word all by itself, but you hear it often in many words. Can you say it again?"</nav>
    <p>After the learner repeats the <b>short a</b> and hears you repeat it, print the letter <b>a</b> on a writing tablet.</p>
    <nav class="quote_text">
    	"The letter <b>a</b> that you see stands for the sound you just made. It is called the <b>short a</b>. Now I am giong to say five words with that sound in it, words that you use every day: <b>am, an, as, at, ax</b>."</nav>
    <p>Print the words in large letters on a sheet of paper or a writing tablet as they appear in the Workbook. Give examples of how each word is used in a spoken sentence, so that the learner understands that they are words. Explain that a word is the smallest unit of speech that has meaning.</p>
    <nav class="quote_text">
    	"The <b>short a</b> sound all by itself doesn't mean anything. But a sound that means something is a word. <b>Am, an, as, at, ax</b> are all words because they have meaning. Now each of these words has two letters in it. Can you name the letters?"</nav>
    <p>Have the learner spell each word, saying the word after it is spelled. Spelling a word means naming its letters in proper left-to-right sequence. Ask the learner:</p>
    <nav class="quote_text">"Now if each of the words has two letters and each letter stands for a sound, how many sounds does each word have?"</nav>
    <p>Repeat the word <b>am</b> slowly. Write and say the <b>short a</b> sound (<b>a</b> as in <b>at</b>); then write and say the word <b>am</b> just below it.</p>
    <nav class="quote_text">
    	"Do you hear the difference between <b>short a</b> (pronounce <b>a</b>) and <b>am</b>? When we say <b>am</b>, we add another sound to the <b>a</b>. What is the sound we added to the <b>a</b> in the word <b>am</b>?"</nav>
    <p>Say the <b>m</b> sound (<b>mmm</b>) as said in the word <b>am</b>. (To correctly isolate this consonant sound, listen to what it sounds like at the end of a word; then lift it from the rest of the word. By doing so, you will minimize injecting a vowel element.) After you've made the <b>m</b> sound, ask the learner:</p>
    <nav class="quote_text">
    	"Did you hear it? Can you say it?"</nav>
    <p>After the learner says the <b>m</b> sound, tell him or her that the letter <b>m</b> stands for the "<b>mmm</b>" sound.</p>
    <nav class="quote_text">
    	"So if we want to write the word <b>am</b>, we must write <b>a-m</b>, because these are the letters that stand for these sounds."</nav>
    <p>Repeat the procedure for <b>an, as, at,</b> and <b>ax</b>. The letter <b>n</b> stands for <b>"nnn,"</b> the letter <b>s</b> stands for <b>"sss."</b> (Actually, the <b>s</b> in <b>as</b> is a soft <b>s</b>, which sounds more like <b>"zzz."</b> Just as the vowel letters represent more than one sound, some consonants also have variant sounds. But at this stage, we are teaching only the sounds used in the words presented in the Workbook.) The letter <b>t</b> stands for <b>"tuh,"</b> and the letter <b>x</b> stands for <b>"ksss."</b></p>
    <p>Have the learner print these words, say them, and spell them. (If you wish to start teaching the learner cursive writing, this is a good place to begin.) In any case, make sure that the learner understands that each word has two sounds and that he or she can match the right sound with the right letter. Point out how the name of each consonant letter gives a hint of the sound each letter stands for. Exaggerate the sound so that the learner can hear them distinctly and recognize them when heard.</p>
    <p>When you are convinced that the learner knows these letter sounds thoroughly, tell them that there are two kinds of letters in the alphabet: vowels and consonants. The letter <b>a</b> is a vowel and <b>m, n, s, t, </b>and <b>x</b> are consonants. The other vowels are <b>e, i, o, </b>and <b>u</b>. All the rest are consonants, although <b>y</b> is sometimes used as a vowel. Explain that the vowels are the most powerful letters in the alphabet, because you can't have a word without one. Consonants need vowels in order to make words. In English, consonants rarely, if ever, stand alone. You needn't elaborate at this point. We merely want to establish the fact that there are two classes of letters: vowels and consonants.</p>
    <p>By now the learner has learned a great deal. He or she is beginning to hear words with a greater awareness of their different sounds, and the learner has seen how these different sounds are represented in the Workbook by alphabet letters. The learner sees that the letters are printed from left to right in the same sequence as they are spoken. The five words can also be printed on cards and flashed to the learner in short drills to help develop quick recognition.</p>
